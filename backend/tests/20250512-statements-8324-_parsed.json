    "How To Avoid Paying Interest On Purchases:",
    "To Avoid Paying Interest On Purchases: Your due date will be a minimum of 21 days after the close of each billing cycle. If you pay your account (or Interest Saving Balance) in full each billing period by the date and time due, no interest is charged on new purchases month to month. Also, we will not impose interest charges on any portion of a purchase balance you repay while that balance is subject to an interest-free period. Subject to any interest-free period for new purchases, we will begin charging interest from the date a transaction (including \u2018any balance transfer, cash advance or overdraft advance), fee or interest charge is added to your daily balance until your account is paid in full. Because we apply payments in excess of your minimum payment first to higher rate balances, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new purchases if you have another balance at a higher interest rate unless you pay your balance (or Interest Saving Balance) in full each month.",

There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer, cash advance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account Agreement. There is a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount_of any foreign transaction for some accounts. For fee-based Chase Pay Over Time plans, there is a fixed monthly fee of up to 1.72% of the amount of each eligible purchase transaction or amount you select to pay over time with no interest. Please see your Account Agreement for information about these fees.",
